  Use when writing, rewriting, translating, or polishing academic reports —
  English/Chinese Word (.docx) documents or presentation decks (.pptx). Encodes
  a working *pattern*: draft content in Markdown first for review, write English
  first then translate to Chinese, keep everything aligned to a single source of
  truth, and treat the user as a co-author whose manual edits are sacred. Trigger
  on tasks like "重寫 Evaluation"、"做中文版"、"整理表格"、"對齊用詞"、"找參考文獻"、

# Academic Report Writing — a working pattern

This is **not** a checklist to satisfy line by line. It is the *pattern* behind
how this user wants academic reports written. Internalize the principles below
and, when a new situation arises, reason from the principle.

## The process spine (follow this order)

1. **Content before format — draft in Markdown first.** Write each section's
   content as Markdown and put it up for review *before* committing it into the
   `.docx`/`.pptx`. Settle *what it says* while it is cheap to change; only then
   pour it into the formatted document. This keeps wording, structure, and facts
   reviewable without fighting Word/PPT layout.
   **Any Markdown must be clean and unambiguous in structure:** a clear heading
   hierarchy, headings and body text in a logical, well-ordered sequence, one
   idea per section, no orphaned or mislevelled headings. The reader should grasp
   the document's shape from the outline alone.
2. **English first, then translate to Chinese.** Author the English version
   first. Produce the Chinese version by *translating from the finished
   English* — not by writing Chinese from scratch and not by literal word
   mapping. Translating down from settled English is what makes the Chinese
   prose read smoothly and stay academically natural.
3. **Plan, confirm, then write.** For any non-trivial rewrite, first propose
   *what content goes where* (e.g. how to split Experimental Results vs
   Evaluation), get it confirmed, then execute.

## The patterns

### A. You are not the only one editing — the user edits by hand too
The key fact: **the user edits the same file by hand, often in parallel with
you** ("不要改掉我手動編輯的東西"、"我剛剛有手動編輯，請注意"). So the version on disk
may already differ from what you last saw, and any of it may be the user's own
wording. Never clobber their work. In practice: re-read the target region right
before editing in case it changed; read the whole document so a local change
stays consistent with the global context; keep changes narrow rather than
rewriting wholesale; and ask before overwriting anything you didn't author.

### B. One source of truth — everything traces back to the canonical artifacts
Terms, stage names, numbers, and claims must all align to the project's canonical
source artifacts — typically the spec/architecture document, the pipeline or
system diagram, and the results/data file. Two halves of the same principle:
- **Align, don't invent.** Don't coin synonyms; match the vocabulary already
  established by the source artifacts. Mind the *ordering* too — but use
  judgment, not a blanket rule. A forward reference is often fine and can even
  help the reader; the problem is only when a term lands before the reader has
  the context to make sense of it or commits to a specific the narrative hasn't
  earned yet (e.g. naming a specific model before the architecture figure that
  defines it). When that premature reveal would confuse or overcommit, hold it
  back and refer generically; otherwise let it stand.
- **Wording problems are usually systemic, not local.** When you hit a term
  that's wrong or off, assume it probably recurs elsewhere: search the document
  for other occurrences, fix them together, and tell the user what you found —
  don't silently patch only the one spot you were pointed at. The user will often
  ask "還有其他地方有這個問題嗎？"; get there first.

### C. Faithful to the data, restrained in the claim and the prose
Write Evaluation/Results strictly from the actual experimental numbers; don't
overclaim. If the report and the data disagree, that contradiction is the bug —
surface it. Keep the register sober: **no jarring metaphorical or figurative
wording** — say what a phenomenon *is* in plain technical terms, not what it is
*like*.

### D. Translation is re-expression in the target idiom, not word-mapping
The Chinese version keeps the English version's formatting/layout *identical* —
only the language changes — but the language is genuinely rewritten:
- Idiomatic Chinese, academic register, polished to read naturally.
- **Flowing prose, no parenthetical crutches** in the Chinese body: rewrite
  bracketed asides into continuous argument. Only touch parentheses in the
  **prose** — leave citations, units, and figure labels alone.
- Titles stay academic, never colloquial.

### E. Citations are claims — they must actually support what they're next to
A reference must genuinely describe the technique it's cited for; a name match is
not enough — verify the paper is about that method. Number citations by order of
first appearance and keep in-text `[n]` in sync with the list; add DOI/URL links
where asked.

### F. Tables & figures: numbered right, grouped, clean, language-correct
- Tables numbered in order; every in-text reference matches the real number.
- Group tables together; move the *real* content over rather than leaving a
  placeholder when the content exists (and only leave a placeholder when it
  genuinely isn't ready).
- English version: no Chinese text left inside tables.
- Hygiene: remove the stray Enter/empty paragraph below images; normalize figure
  sizes and alignment; size the caption paragraph to the table width; fix broken
  justification and hyphenation artifacts (e.g. a wrapped "resolu-tion" →
  "resolution").

### G. Format hygiene & deliberate use of space
**No emoji anywhere** — not in the report, the slides, captions, or headings.
This is academic work; keep it text and typography only. Don't leave large empty
regions — use the page/slide.
- **In the docx specifically:** no awkward justification gaps — when justified
  text leaves an over-stretched line, pad the short line so spacing reads evenly.
- **In slides specifically:** design them *as slides* (cards, callouts,
  hierarchy), not as a wall of report prose; keep title-case and punctuation
  consistent across all slides; align slide wording to the docx and diagram;
  cover all the report's sections; keep footers and page numbers consistent after
  any insert/reorder.

### H. Diagrams: architecture / flow / framework — author in HTML, export to PNG
Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and framework figures follow the same
content-before-format spine as the prose: **settle the structure first, render
last.**
1. **Draft the structure before drawing.** State the nodes/stages and the
   connections between them in text (or a quick outline) and get it confirmed
   *before* producing any picture — the same way section content is reviewed in
   Markdown first. The boxes, their order, and the arrows are the "content"
   here; the visual is just the formatting.
2. **Align the diagram to the source artifacts.** Stage names, module labels,
   arrow directions, and the overall topology must match the canonical
   spec/architecture doc and the prose that references the figure (pattern B).
   The figure *is* one of the one-source-of-truth artifacts — if the diagram and
   the text disagree, that contradiction is the bug; surface it.
3. **Build the figure in HTML, then export to PNG.** Author the diagram as a
   self-contained HTML file (HTML/CSS layout, inline styles, web fonts) so the
   layout is precise, editable, and re-renderable. Then **render that HTML and
   save it as a PNG** for embedding into the `.docx`/`.pptx`. Keep the HTML
   source around as the editable master — when the diagram changes, edit the
   HTML and re-export, never hand-patch the PNG.
4. **Diagram hygiene.** No emoji (pattern G). Clean, even spacing; consistent box
   sizes, fonts, and arrow styles; readable label sizes at the final embedded
   scale. Crop tight — no dead whitespace around the exported PNG. Match the
   figure's wording (title-case, terminology) to the docx and the other figures.

## Quick self-check before declaring done
- Drafted content reviewed in Markdown before formatting; EN authored, ZH
  translated down from it.
- Whole doc read first; manual edits intact; changes kept narrow and targeted.
- Every term/number traces to the source artifacts; any wording fix was checked
  for other occurrences, not just patched where pointed.
- Claims match the data; no overclaiming; no jarring metaphors; no internal
  contradictions.
- ZH: idiomatic academic prose, no parenthetical asides, layout identical to EN.
- Citations on-topic, renumbered by appearance, linked.
- Tables/figures: numbered, grouped, clean (no stray Enters), captions sized,
  English-only in EN version.
- docx: no awkward justification gaps. No emoji or dead whitespace anywhere.
- Diagrams: structure confirmed before drawing; built in HTML then exported to
  PNG with the HTML kept as editable master; aligned to source artifacts;
  cropped tight and clean.
